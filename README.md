There are 3 total changes compared to the original Colemak. The motivation is to reduce strain by moving D and H out of the center columns while keeping bottom row and shortcuts intact.

- P and D are swapped.
- M and H are swapped.
- ; and ' are swapped.

## Installation
I included a Windows Installer and a AutoHotkey script.
I may include MACOS and Linux installation files in the future as well.
